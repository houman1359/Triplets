POOL_Data.mat: contains three variables NC, SC, INT which are noise correlation, signal correlation, and interaction values respectively. Each of them are cells like NC{L,C} where L referes to being either nonlabeles (L=1) or projection pairs (L=9) and C referes to the correctness (C=1 for correct trials and C=2 for incorrect trials).


POOLS.m: plots the within and between pool figures.
