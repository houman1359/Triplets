NPvC: contains both the NPvC set of codes and the glmnet used to run the GLM analysis.

SIMULATION: contains the code which is used to generate the simulations and then fit the data to both NPvC and GLM and compute single neuron and interaction 
information using both NPvC and GLM. The folder contains another code which can be used to visualize the results saved in the folder results.
